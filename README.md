How to Use
===================
Very easy! It is designed to be a drop-in component, so no static library, no additional dependencies.
Just copy ImageCropView.h and ImageCropView.m to your project, and that's it. This project comes with a working example (as target ImageCropView)
to demostrate the basic usage.
